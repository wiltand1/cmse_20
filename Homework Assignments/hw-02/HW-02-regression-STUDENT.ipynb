    "* Use Git to create a repository, track changes to the files within the repository, and push those changes to a remote repository.\n",

    "## Part 1: Setting up a repository for tracking changes (3 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you're going to add it to the cmse202-s20-turnin repository you created in class so that you can track your progress on the assignment and preserve the final version that you turn in. In order to do this you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Navigate to your `cmse202-s20-turnin` repository and create a new directory called `hw-02`.\n",
    "* Move this notebook into that new directory in your repository, then add it and commit it to your repository.\n",
    " * Finally, to test that everything is working, \"git push\" the file so that it ends up in your GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: Make sure you've added your PTA as a collaborators\\ to your \"turnin\" respository with \"Read\" access so that we can see your assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Section 001: nchamusah14\n",
    "* Section 002: nchamusah14\n",
    "* Section 003: genster6\n",
    "\n",
    "Also important: Make sure that the version of this notebook that you are working on is the same one that you just added to your repository! If you are working on a different copy of the noteobok, none of your changes will be tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "If everything went as intended, the file should now show up on your GitHub account in the `cmse202-s20-turnin` repository under the `hw-02` directory that you just created. Periodically, you'll be asked to commit your changes to the repository and push them to the remote GitHub location. Of course, you can always commit your changes more often than that, if you wish. It can be good to get into a habit of committing your changes any time you make a significant modification, or when you stop working on the project for a bit."
