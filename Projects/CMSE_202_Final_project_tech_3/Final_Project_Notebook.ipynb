    "We will be developing an agent-based model for the deer population in Michigan.  This will help us determine optimal hunting levels to maintain a stable deer population in various areas of Michigan.  One of the main concerns with deer in Michigan is that there are no longer enough hunters to control the population level.  Because of this, populations in many areas of Michigan, particularly southeast Michigan, have skyrocketed.  This can cause many issues for the people living in these areas since car accidents are more common.  There are also potential problems regarding the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) since the deer population is denser.  \n",

This will provide useful information on how exactly deer are hunted in Michigan and what attributes should put deer at risk.  This data is from 2018, so a lot of the information presented should still be accurate to the deer herd and hunting strategies now.\n"

    "Testing the model to see if it works may be difficult to do, since finding exact information regarding the total deer population levels has been difficult to do.  One possible solution to this is to just figure out how many hunters would be needed to maintain a deer population instead of trying to fit this model to real world data."

    "The class below is capable of instantiating various deer throughout the model. If a deer's location is not specified, a deer's location on the simulation board is chosen at random. This is done with respect to the given dimensions of the board. Similarly, if an age is not specified, then a deer's age will be given at random. Again, for the sex of the deer, if not specified, the chances of a deer being male or female are equal and chosen at random. As for pregnancy status, when a deer is instantiated, its `pregnant` attribute is set to `False`. This will be dealt with in a later method. The `antler` attribute indicates the presence or absence of antlers. Again, the deer will be initialized with not having antlers, as the complications of this phenomenon will be addressed in a method. The final attribute defines the `status` of the deer. Since this model is most-concerned with the dead population, it needs to be able to track the amount of deer that are still alive. This will allow the model to differentiate between a deer that is dead versus a deer that is alive.\n",

    "The `move` method allows a deer to relocate (or not) during every timestep. The direction in which they move is chosen at random, however, they are bounded by the edges of the simulation board. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the `reproduce` method, female deer are capable of being impregnated under certain conditions during `'mating'` season. In order for mating to occur, a female deer must be in the same location as her male partner. Both of these deer need to be at least of age 1. This is typically the time when deer reach sexual maturity. Another feature of the `reproduce` method is that it is capable of producing a fawn. This can occur when the season is defined to be `'calving'`. If a female deer happens to be pregnant during this particular season, she gives birth to a fawn at her current location. Males are not too concerned with this method, as they are not capable of bearing a fawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A method that does concern the male deer is that of the `antler_status`. Male deer tend to grow their antlers around the same time that they reach sexual maturity. Once they reach this point, their antlers will grow seasonally. This progression begins in April and ends near the end of the calendar year where the antlers begin to deteriorate and fall off. Because hunting licenses are categorized in antler and antlerless sectors, this process of antler growth in male deer should present a much more accurate model.\n"
